# RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To run the program import it into a java IDE such as Eclipse. run the SimulationRunner class's main function. It will likely be seen that errors are popping up in the test package, this is because the JUnit libaray cannot be packaged with the program when we submit it. This is easily fixed by adding JUnit4 to the build path. The chosen number of replications is 117, so if R is unchanged it will take some time to finish running. Once it has completed, 117 .txt files will be created within the Results folder.
